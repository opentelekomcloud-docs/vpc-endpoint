VPC Endpoints
=============

VPC endpoints are secure and private channels for connecting VPCs to VPC endpoint services.

You can create a VPC endpoint to connect a resource in your VPC to a VPC endpoint service in another VPC of the same region.

A VPC endpoint comes with a VPC endpoint service. VPC endpoints vary depending on the type of the VPC endpoint services that they can access.

-  VPC endpoints for accessing interface VPC endpoint services are elastic network interfaces that have private IP addresses.
-  VPC endpoints for accessing gateway VPC endpoint services are gateways, with routes configured to distribute traffic to the associated VPC endpoint services.
