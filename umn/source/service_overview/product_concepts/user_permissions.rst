User Permissions
================

The cloud system provides two types of user permissions by default, user management and resource management.

-  User management refers to management of users, user groups, and user group permissions.
-  Resource management refers to access control over cloud service resources.

VPCEP provides two types of resources: VPC endpoint services and VPC endpoints, both of which are region-level resources. The required permissions must be added for users in the project.
